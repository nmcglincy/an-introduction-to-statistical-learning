# Chapter 1

The introduction outlines three basic tasks in statistical learning:

1. __Regression__ - predicting _continuous numerical_ values from other continuous values
2. __Classification__ - predicting class membership; has a _categorical_ or _qualitative_ output.

In both these tasks, we are trying to predict an output.

3. __Clustering__ - here we are not trying to predict an output variable, but instead are trying to understand how similar/different a set of observations are, usually based on a number of variables.
